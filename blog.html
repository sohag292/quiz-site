    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. What is the differents between <span class="text-amber-500"> forEach, find, map, &
        filter</span> in javascript?</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">Ans: <span class="bg-green-300">map()</span> executes the same code on every element in an array
      and returns a new array with the updated elements. <span class="bg-green-300">forEach()</span> is used to execute
      the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <span
        class="bg-green-300">filter()</span> checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and
      returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <span
        class="bg-green-300">find()</span> returns first element of the array that satisfies the condition specified in
      the callback function.</p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. What is the differents between <span class="text-amber-500">localStorage,
        sessionStorage & cookies</span>?</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">Ans: <span class="bg-green-300">Local storage</span>
      Local storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer in a key-value pair format and has no
      expiration date. Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible via JavaScript and HTML5. Its Capacity:
      10MB. <span class="bg-green-300">Session storage</span> stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer
      only for the current session, expiring the data on tab close. Data is never transferred to the server and is
      accessible client-side from the same tab. Its Capacity: 5MB. <span class="bg-green-300">Cookies</span> store small
      amounts of data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests and their expiration can be set
      from either server or client. They are primarily used for server-side reading. Its Capacity: 4KB </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. What is <span class="text-amber-500">Event Loop</span>?</h1>

    <p class="text-xl">Ans:The <span class="bg-green-300">event loop</span> is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s
      asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it
      gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in
      line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.The event queue is responsible
      for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct
      sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to
      a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API
      starts its own single-threaded operation.An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation
      is processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this
      operation back in for processing.</p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. How does the <span class="text-amber-500">quizTimer function</span> works?</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">Ans:
      This code defines a function called <span class="bg-green-300">quizTimer</span> that takes one parameter called dismiss.If the dismiss parameter is truthy  then the function will call the clearInterval method and pass it a variable called timer. This will stop the timer that was previously started with setInterval.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">5. How Does the <span class="text-amber-500">chooseQuiz Function</span> works?</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">Ans:
      The <span class="bg-green-300">chooseQuiz</span> function is used to update the user's answer to a quiz. It does this by checking if the quiz has already been answered before, and if it has, it updates the answer in the answers array. If it has not been answered before, it adds a new answer object to the answers array. Finally, it updates the user interface to show the current answers.
